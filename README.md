1. **Filter Buttons**: Easily switch between viewing all tasks, active tasks, or completed tasks. 

2. **Editing Tasks**: Click on a task to edit its content. It's like giving your tasks a makeover. ðŸ’…

3. **Check All and Uncheck All**: Feeling productive? Click "Check All" to mark all tasks as completed.  Hit "Uncheck All" to reset. It's like a digital high-five!
